# Protein Dynamics

This repository contains Python modules and functions for interacting with
protein prediction data from [BrisSynBio](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/brissynbio/).

## Modules

**protein.py**

Functions for interacting with the raw data in .pdb format. Also contains procedures
for generating random joint and protein sequences.

**representations.py**

Functions for creating simplified representations of the data.

See the following tutorial notebooks to get started.

* Exploring Representations.ipynb
* Creating New Proteins.ipynb


**distributions.py**

Functions for exploring the distributions of parameters of the representations.

 See the tutorial to get started.

* Comparing Distributions.ipynb
