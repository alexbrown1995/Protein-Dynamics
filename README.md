# Protein Dynamics

This repository contains Python modules and functions for interacting with
protein prediction data from BrisSynBio.

## Modules:

**protein.py** - contains functions for interacting with the raw data in .pdb format.

**representations.py** - contains functions for creating simplified representations
of the data. See the notebooks *Exploring Representations.ipynb* and *Creating New
Proteins.ipynb* to get started.

**distributions.py** - contains functions for exploring the distributions of parameters
of the representations. See *Comparing Distributions.ipynb* to get started.
