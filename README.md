protein prediction data from BrisSynBio.

## Modules

**protein.py**

Functions for interacting with the raw data in .pdb format.

**representations.py**

Functions for creating simplified representations of the data. See the notebooks

* Exploring Representations.ipynb
* Creating New Proteins.ipynb

to get started.

**distributions.py**

Functions for exploring the distributions of parameters of the representations. See

* Comparing Distributions.ipynb

to get started.
